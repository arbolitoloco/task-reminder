# task-reminder
Simple tool to setup a daily work routine and full-screen browser reminders

Currently designed to work with Chrome in Windows 10, alongside PowerShell and Task Scheduler.

For now it's simply an HTML with vanilla JavaScript that will dynamically display the task scheduled for a time block in full-screen mode, 
thus disrupting anything you're doing in your computer.

Setup
-------

1. Copy all files to desired folder
2. Edit time slots and tasks/reminders inside JavaScript portion of the HTML
3. Schedule same task in desired times to be reminded throughout the day

Future Development Plan
-------

In the future, I'd like to transform this little tool in a cross-platform standalone software.
Candidates for development are:

- Electron
- Flutter
